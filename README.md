# Crowdfund: A product crowdfunding page

Crowdfund is an application used to crowdfund the Mastercraft Bamboo Monitor Riser by allowing users to make
pledges on the product or products of their choice that will be eventually shipped to them once built.
## Overview

The Mastercraft Bamboo Monitor Riser is a sturdy and stylish platform that elevates your screen to a more comfortable viewing height thus reducing neck and eye strain. The Mastercraft Bamboo Monitor Riser has 3 products; the Bamboo Stand, the Black Edition Stand and the Mahogany Special Edition. Willing backers can pledge on some or all of the available Monitor Risers.

This project is a Frontend Mentor Challenge solution.

- Make a selection of which pledge to make
- See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
- See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
